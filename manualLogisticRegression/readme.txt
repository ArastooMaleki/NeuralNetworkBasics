this project is about binary classification witch we decide about witch picture
is cat and witch is noncat picture. 
in this part we use a simple neural net with only one hidden unit  in one layer.
so it is simply a logistic regression . 
during this first course we use this dataset and progect in diffrent place to compare
diffrent kind of neural net and its performance . 
in this folder we try to build and train this model manuualy . 
so we dont use library like keras . 
and we use numpy in most places .
